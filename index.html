    <h2>Changing giving..</h2>
    People often talk about tackling problems using technology and come up with creative
    problems to solve when the most obvious one is largely ignored...I'm of course talking about poverty

    *I'm not saying that I have a technical solution or that there is even one
    I'm just saying we should be trying more and trying many different ways

        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>
        Millions of *insert curreny* are collected each year in many different countries
        and yet the number of people in poverty never seems to decrease;
        aside from the obvious excuse of a growing population, there are many other reasons
        why this is is the case
        <br>
        I believe (same as many other people I'm sure) that the main reason is the fact that 
        most of the money collected either never reaches those who need it,
        because either the charity is fake or it's legit but the bosses need 6 figure salaries
        ooor it's being invested in arms and tabacco shares (even a 5 year old knows that's just wrong)
        <br>
        and when the money does actually make it to them it only serves to enable those poor people
        to the point where they no longer know how to take care of themselves without aid from others.
        this of course creates a negative loop where poor people want/need to keep asking for money and 
        and charities can keep raising money. <br>some charities probably prefer it that way
