    <h2>Changing giving..</h2>
    People often talk about tackling problems using technology and come up with creative
    problems to solve when the most obvious one is largely ignored...I'm of course talking about poverty

    *I'm not saying that I have a technical solution or that there is even one
    I'm just saying we should be trying more and trying many different ways
    </p>

        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>
        Millions of *insert currency* are collected each year in many different countries
        and yet the number of people in poverty never seems to decrease;
        aside from the obvious excuse of a growing population, there are many other reasons
        why this is the case
        <br>
        I believe (same as many other people I'm sure) that the main reason is the fact that 
        most of the money collected either never reaches those who need it,
        because either the charity is fake or it's legit but the bosses need 6 figure salaries
        ooor it's being invested in arms and tabacco shares (even a 5 year old knows that's just wrong)
        <br>
        and when the money does actually make it to them it only serves to enable those poor people
        to the point where they no longer know how to take care of themselves without aid from others.
        this of course creates a negative loop where poor people want/need to keep asking for money and 
        charities can keep raising money. <br> which makes sense to them and some charities probably prefer it that way

        </p>

        <h3>The suggestion</h3>
        <p>
        In order to do better than regular charities and to restore the public's faith in charities
        the following suggestions might help:<br></br>

        -Single purpose charities which aim to collect a certain amount of money
        and promise to solve small problem or at least decrease it's effects in a measurable way<br>

        -Finding ways to raise and use money OPENLY: so that people can see that every penny that they give
        actually goes into the pool of available money and that at least 80% of the pool makes it to the people
        the money is being raised for

        <h3>Where the money should go</h3>
        <p>
        To get someone or a group of people out of poverty whether they are from a third world country
        or here in the uk...I believe only 3 things are required</br>
    
        1: Food</br>
        *they should be able to eat without begging for coins or for food
        ...I don't understand why that's not a basic human right in most stable countries</br><br>

        2: Roof</br>
        *a warm place where they can sleep without registering or meeting anyone's demands
        *this would of course require a lot of money to buy or rent large properties</br></br>

        3: Support</br>
        *providing them with or showing them ways of retaining what they have gained
        and taking care of themselves
        *this is the part which might require governments to step up</br>
        <br>
