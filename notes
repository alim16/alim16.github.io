People often talk about tackling problems using technology and come up with creative
problems to solve when the most obvious one is largely ignored...I'm of course talking about poverty

*I'm not saying that I have a technical solution or that there is even one
I'm just saying we should be trying more and trying many different ways

Millions of *insert curreny* are collected each year in many different countries
and yet the number of people in poverty never seems to decrease;
aside from the obvious excuse of a growing population, there are many other reasons
why this is is the case

I believe (same as many other people I'm sure) that the main reason is the fact that 
most of the money collected either never reaches those who need it,
because either the charity is fake or it's legit but the bosses need 6 figure salaries
ooor it's being invested arms and tabacco shares (even a 5 year old knows that's just wrong)

and when the money does actually make it to them it only serves to enable those poor people
to the point where they no longer know how to take care of themselves without aid from others.
this of course creates a negative loop where poor people want/need to keep asking for money and 
and charities can keep raising money. some charities probably prefer it that way

...or its not used correctly
to help them

In order to do better than regular charities and to restore the public's faith in charities
the following suggestions might help:

-Single purpose charities which aim to collect a certain amount of money
and promise to solve small problem or at least decrease it's effects in a measurable way

-Finding ways to raise and use money OPENLY: so that people can see that every penny that they give
actually goes into the pool of available money and that at least 80% of the pool makes it to the people
the money is being raised for




----------------------------------------------

To get someone or a group of people out of poverty whether they are from a third world country
or here in the uk...I believe only 3 things are required

1: Roof
*they should be able to eat without begging for coins or for food
...I don't understand why that's not a basic human right in every country

2: Roof
*a warm place where they can sleep without registering or meeting anyone's demands
*this would of course require a lot of money to buy or rent large properties

3: Support
*providing them with or showing them ways retaining what they have gained
and taking care of themselves
*this is the part which might require governments to step up




Obviously poverty is not something that can be eradicated
